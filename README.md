# medical-charges_analysis
Our objective is to find a way to estimate the value in the "charges" column using the values in the other columns. If we can do so for the historical data, then we should able to estimate charges for new customers too, simply by asking for information like their age, sex, BMI, no. of children, smoking habits and region.
